ASA Datathon
=============

This repository contains the code and data for the ASA 2014 Datathon entry for myself, Brian Hamlin and Sarah Quandri

Notes
======

- All input data is in data/input/ - we used census data from the 2010 Census aggregated into neighborhoods and a network of adjacent neighborhoods. Information on how this was done is in database_notes_brian.txt, though for full details you many want to contact Brian himself

- The statistical analysis is completed using run_script.R, which has a comment saying where I ran a little python script to generate information for our dependent variable in our regression.  Sorry its not very clean, we ran out of time

- Network visualizations were completed using ORA[http://casos.cs.cmu.edu]
