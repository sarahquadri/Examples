ASA Datathon
=============

This repository contains the code and data (untar the data dir) for the ASA 2014 Datathon entry for myself, [Brian Hamlin](http://ct.light42.com/) and [Sarah Quadri](https://github.com/sarahquadri/Examples)



Notes
======

- Unfortunately in my sleep-deprived state after the event when I was putting the code up, I somehow lost the last little bit of the analysis.  Basically, all I did was run an L1 regularized linear regression w/ glmnet, using all the census variables on the logged income disparity.  Lemme know if you want to replicate and can't and I'll piece it back together

- All input data is in data/input/ - we used census data from the 2010 Census aggregated into neighborhoods and a network of adjacent neighborhoods. Information on how this was done is in database_notes_brian.txt, though for full details you many want to contact Brian himself

- The statistical analysis is completed using run_script.R, which has a comment saying where I ran a little python script to generate information for our dependent variable in our regression.  Sorry its not very clean, we ran out of time

- Network visualizations were completed using [ORA](http://casos.cs.cmu.edu)
