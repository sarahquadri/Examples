# Function "detect.misclass" 
#
# Inputs:  class.v = a matrix read from a CSV file listing the classification of points
#          p       = a matrix read from a CSV file of "m" points with "n" measured attributes
#       
# 
# Returns: A list containing the following:
#          "err.found": "TRUE"  if error(s) in classification found
#                       "False" if no errors in classification found
#
#          "err.loc"  : Location of points(s) in "p" where errors in 
#                       classification found for example: $err.loc = [1,2,34]
#                       NULL   if no errors in classification found
#
#          "new.class": New classification of points found in error
#                       NULL   if no errors in classification found
#
#          FALSE if:
#                    1. Either "class.v" has less than four (4) elements or 
#                       "p" has less than four (4) rows:
#                       a. It doesn't make sense to classify an empty set or 
#                          one point
#                       b. Classifying only two (2) points, if they aren't the same 
#                          classification, the algorithm will just switch the 
#                          classifications.
#                       c. Classifying only three (3) points also doesn't make sense 
#                          because:
#                          i. "K" will be (3), which means we evaluate all points, 
#                             but it doesn't make sense to include the point being 
#                             evaluated as a "nearest neighbor" and the tally would 
#                             be biased.
#                          ii. The algorithm could be modified so that if there are 
#                              only three (3) elements, and set "K" to 2, but this 
#                              also doesn't make sense, because the tally could 
#                              result in a tie vote
#
#                    2. Number of classifications NOT EQUAL to the number of rows of 
#                       "p" 
#                    3. All elements of "class.v" are NOT numeric
#                    4. All elements of "p" are NOT numeric  
#
