This program generates 14 random points with x and y coordinates and classifies if these points are inside of
a circle with a particular center and radius.  The output of this program is a plot of all of the outside points in purple and
all of the inside points in green.

The point of this program was to get us into the "classification" mindset for a Machine Learning project (see KNN.R).
