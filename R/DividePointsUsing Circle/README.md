This program generates 14 random points with x and y coordinates and classifies the points as being inside or outside of
a circle with a particular center and radius.  The output of this program is a plot of the outside points in purple and the inside points in green.

The point of this program was to get us into the "classification" mindset for a Machine Learning project (see KNN.R).
