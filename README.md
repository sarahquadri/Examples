Examples of Sarah Quadri's Work:

Please Note: 

I'm re-vamping my SAS analysis of CEO Compensation from Fortune 500 companies, but the final group report is available for review.  I'll also add some Excel Pivot Tables soon.

List of Work Examples:

1. American Sociological Association's Datathon 2014:
   This was my first datathon: we had to come up with a problem, collect and analyze data, and create a presentation in
   24 hours, focusing on an urban issue.  We decided to look at data from San Francisco and try to determine what factors
   cause "disparity" between neighborhoods. (Basically, why is the Castro more affulent than the Mission, etc). 
   Kenny then threw all of Brian's US Census Data into a Python program that tried to cluster attributes such as car ownership,
   median age, employment, etc to come up with a model to determne what makes a neighborhood more "affluent" than another.
   
2. R Coding Examples:
   Just a few, will keep on adding; basically from an R course taught by Dr. John Angell of CSU East Bay who wanted us to get
   a "taste" of Machine Learning,  I'll be adding a program that takes CSV files from individual sensors and combines data.

3.	Group Project Checklist: 
Project Management Guide to facilitate time management and the successful completion of group project milestones 
in the CSU East Bay Statistics Department.
