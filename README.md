Examples of Sarah Quadri's Work:

Please Note: 

I'm porting my SAS analysis of CEO Compensation from Fortune 500 companies to be compatible with "SAS Studio", free a web-based version of SAS that can be run on multiple platforms.  In the meantime, I've made the final group paper available for review under "/SAS/CEO Compensation".  I'll also add some Excel examples (Pivot Tables, V-Lookups, etc) and Python code (I'm learning on my own right now and will be taking a Data Mining course through Coursera that requires coding in Python).

List of Work Examples:

1. American Sociological Association's Datathon 2014:
   This was my first datathon: we had to collect and analyze data, and create a presentation in 24 hours, which focused on a       current urban issue of our choosing.  We decided to look at data from San Francisco and try to determine what factors
   cause economic "disparity" between neighborhoods. 

   We threw US Census Data from PostgreSQL into a Python program that tried to cluster attributes such as car ownership, median    age, employment, etc., to come up with a regression model that describes factors that make a neighborhood more or less          economically disparate than another.
   
2. R Coding Examples:
   Just a few, will keep on adding; basically from an R course taught by Dr. John Angell of CSU East Bay who wanted us to get
   a "taste" of Machine Learning,  I'll be adding a program that takes CSV files from individual sensors and combines data.

3.	Group Project Checklist: 
Project Management Guide to facilitate time management and the successful completion of group project milestones 
in the CSU East Bay Statistics Department.
